      <description>By now, you should have followed the  Installation instructions. You should have Hugo and Node installed, and a local copy of a forked version of Cupper. You should also have run npm install in the root of that codebase.
&amp;ldquo;Cleaning&amp;rdquo; the content folder Before you can start writing documentation, there are a few things still to do in order to get set up. At the moment, your version of Cupper is a facsimile of the original, containing all the content you&amp;rsquo;re reading right now.</description>

      <description>Serving locally While you&amp;rsquo;re creating content for your project, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to see what the finished product looks like. Fortunately, Cupper is easy to serve locally using the serve command:
npm run serve This will serve your working project from localhost:1313. Whenever you make changes to your files, the site will automatically rebuild. No need to refresh the web page!
Publishing on Github Pages Cupper creates a /docs folder containing the latest version of your site whenever you do an npm run build or a git commit.</description>

      <description>Cupper&amp;rsquo;s output site includes a one-page  Print version of the generated library, available at /print-version. So, if your library base URL is https://yourName.github.io/your-library, you can print the whole library — to PDF if wanted — from the following address:
https://yourName.github.io/your-library/print-version     Print styles are also provided for individual pattern pages so, if you wanted to print off a single pattern document, you can!
