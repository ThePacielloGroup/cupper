## Install Hugo

First you need to install Hugo globally.

### OSX users

If you are a Mac user and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your system, installing Hugo is simple:

{{<cmd>}}brew install hugo{{</cmd>}}

Alternatively, you can manually [install Hugo from a package](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). You can verify the installation was successful by typing:

{{<cmd>}}hugo version{{</cmd>}}

### Windows users

Installing on Windows is a little more involved than on OSX. The authors of Hugo provide [a guide](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/installing-on-windows/) with instructions for technical and less technical users.

It's also best you install a Windows Subsystem for running Linux, and therefore [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (**Cupper** incorporates some bash commands in its scripts). [Microsoft offer a complete guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/commandline/wsl/install_guide).

## Install Node & NPM

It is likely you already have Node and NPM installed on your system. If so, you can skip this step. Otherwise, [refer to NPM's own guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), which includes a video tutorial.

## Get the files

**Cupper** is hosted on Github. To start using it, you'll need to get the files from there. If you are comfortable with the command line, just fork the [github.com/ThePacielloGroup/cupper](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/cupper) repository, then do a `git clone` to your local system. Replace `[your username]` in the following:

{{<cmd>}}git clone https://github.com/[your username]/cupper.git{{</cmd>}}

If the command line is not your thing, use Github's web interface to fork  [github.com/ThePacielloGroup/cupper](https://github.com/ThePacielloGroup/cupper) and choose **Open in Desktop** from **Clone or download** (see figure 1, below).

If you do not have a version of the Github desktop client installed, follow the prompts after clicking **Open in Desktop**.

While you're in the Github interface, you might as well set up the publishing source for the live site. Choose the Master branch/docs option under **Settings → Github Pages → Source**. See {{% pattern "Serving" %}} for more details.

Once you have your local copy of the files, move to the root of that folder and in your terminal run an npm installation:

{{<cmd>}}npm install{{</cmd>}}

Now it's time to consult the {{% pattern "Setup" %}} pattern.
