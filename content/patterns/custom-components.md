## Finding

There are several components on this page that are custom made. This covers complex components like the "explore unicef"-dropdown, search filters ("Contract type", "Locations", "Functional Area" and "Position level") and the search input/mechanism.

They are not accessible by keyboard and fail WCAG Criteria like 4.1.2 for not adding appropriate name, role and/or value.

They are considered out of scope for this audit as they need further in-depth review to discover all issues in all possible states and applications, and might require a thorough rewrite.
