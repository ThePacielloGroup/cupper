      <title>Library structure</title>

      <description>Before you can set about documenting patterns, you need to know where everything goes. The simplest folder structure looks like this:
└── content ├── _index.md └── patterns ├── name-of-my-pattern.md └── name-of-my-other-pattern.md   /content - This is where all of your content lives. You won&amp;rsquo;t need to visit any other folders very frequently. _index.md — This is the content for your home page. /patterns — This is the folder where individual pattern files are kept.</description>

      <title>Markdown &amp; metadata</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/infusion/patterns/writing/markdown-and-metadata/</link>

      <description>In Infusion, design patterns are documented using markdown. To create a new pattern file, just add a file with the .md extension to the /patterns folder. It&amp;rsquo;s recommended you use &amp;ldquo;kebab case&amp;rdquo; to name the file ( words separated by hyphens). For example, a pattern with the title &amp;ldquo;Menu button&amp;rdquo; should probably have the filename menu-button. Then you get a nice clean URL: your-company.com/patterns/menu-button.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with writing markdown, there are a number of tutorials available.</description>

      <title>Expandable sections</title>

      <description>In some cases, where there is a lot of content, it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to collapse certain sections. That way, readers get an overview of what&amp;rsquo;s in the content and can choose where to focus in. Infusion provides a shortcode method for creating expandable sections which generates accessible markup using aria-expanded.
The expandable shortcode takes three parameters:
 label — This is the label for the the section heading. level — This is the heading level (e.</description>

      <title>Code blocks</title>

      <description>Markdown already supports code samples both inline (using single backticks like `some code here`) and in blocks. Infusion will syntax highlight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you provide the correct language in the formulation of the block.
So, this&amp;hellip;
```html &amp;lt;button aria-pressed=&#34;false&#34;toggle me&amp;lt;/button ```  &amp;hellip; will result in this:
&amp;lt;button aria-pressed=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;&amp;gt;toggle me&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt;  Note that the syntax highlighting uses a greyscale theme. Infusion is careful not to use color as part of its own design, because these colors may clash with those of the design being illustrated and discussed.</description>

      <title>CodePen embedding</title>

      <description>Sometimes just pictures of the pattern you&amp;rsquo;re documenting aren&amp;rsquo;t enough. Interactive patterns benefit from live demos, so that readers can test their functionality.
Infusion offers a couple of ways to do this. The first is by embedding CodePen demos into the content. The codePen shortcode takes just one argument: the codePen&amp;rsquo;s ID.
&amp;#x7b;{% codePen VpVNKW %}}  This will embed the identified codePen into the content wherever you placed the shortcode, with the result view showing by default:</description>

      <title>Including images</title>

      <description>From time to time, you&amp;rsquo;ll be wanting to include images illustrating the documented pattern in hand. Images live in the static folder, which is a sibling of the /content folder you&amp;rsquo;ll be mostly working in.
├── content └── static └── images ├── logo.png └── menu-button.gif   When you first make a copy of Infusion, Infusion&amp;rsquo;s own logo will be included. You should replace this with your own company or project logo.</description>

      <title>Installation</title>

      <description>Infusion is built using the static site engine, Hugo, and NPM. The codebase is available to download on Github. Let&amp;rsquo;s get set up step-by-step.
1. Install Hugo First we need to install Hugo globally.
OSX users If you are a Mac user and have Homebrew on your system, installing Hugo is simple:
brew install hugo Alternatively, you can manually install Hugo from a package. You can verify the installation was successful by typing:</description>

      <title>Library setup</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/infusion/patterns/library-setup/</link>

      <guid>https://heydon.github.io/infusion/patterns/library-setup/</guid>
      <description>By now, you should have followed the   Installation  instructions. You should have Hugo and Node installed, and a local copy of a forked version of Infusion. You should also have run npm install in the root of that codebase.
&amp;ldquo;Cleaning&amp;rdquo; the content folder Before you can start documenting patterns, there are a few things still to do in order to get set up. At the moment, your version of Infusion is a facsimile of the original, containing all this documentation content.</description>

      <title>Notes &amp; warnings</title>

      <description>Infusion acknowledges that simple markdown is limiting when it comes to writing compelling documentation, so it provides a number of &amp;ldquo;shortcodes&amp;rdquo;. Shortcodes offer a simple syntax for including rich content. For example, Infusion provides shortcodes for including notes and warnings.
Notes You may wish to pick out some content in your pattern&amp;rsquo;s documentation as a note — an aside to the main thrust of the pattern&amp;rsquo;s description. This is possible using the following syntax:</description>

      <title>References</title>

      <description>Cross-references Infusion provides an easy mechanism to cross-reference patterns, by title, using the pattern shortcode. For example, I can reference the   Notes &amp;amp; warnings  pattern. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the markdown looks like, including the shortcode:
I can reference the &amp;#x7b;{% pattern &#34;Notes &amp; warnings&#34; %}} pattern here.  This saves you having to worry about pathing and decorates the generated link with a bookmark icon, identifying the link as a pattern reference visually.</description>

      <title>Serving</title>

      <description>Serving locally While you&amp;rsquo;re creating content for your library, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to see what the finished product looks like. Fortunately, Infusion is easy to serve locally using the serve command:
npm run serve This will serve your working library on localhost:1313. Whenever you make changes to your library&amp;rsquo;s files, the site will automatically rebuild. No need to refresh the web page!
Publishing on Github Pages The easiest way to host your pattern library so you have a link to share is to run the host command.</description>

      <title>Writing inline demos</title>
      <link>https://heydon.github.io/infusion/patterns/code/writing-inline-demos/</link>

      <description>There are some issues with   CodePen embedding  , like them not working offline. They also come with CodePen branding, which will clash with the pattern you&amp;rsquo;re trying to illustrate.
Infusion offers another option: a special demo shortcode that allows you to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly into the markdown file. The outputted demo is encapsulated using Shadow DOM, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about broken styles and global JS.</description>
